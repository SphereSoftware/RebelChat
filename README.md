`RebelChat` is an integrated `Chat` system for the Hackable Atom Editor. It is a modern way to keep
in touch with any team, and keep your messaging under control right in your editor.

## Why

This project aims to provide unified `UI`/`UX` for all available communication channels. We do believe that you
don't need to install and track all different chat apps, if all you need is just `chat` with your
friends and colleagues.

## How to start

To start `RebelChat` just press `ctrl`-`alt`-`cmd`-`m`, enter you credentials and enjoy
your chatting experience.

By default `RebelChat` provides some `keymaps`. But feel free to change it any way you want. You can
read more about `keymaps` [here](http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth/)

### Default Keymaps

Here is all default `keymaps`, but you can always disable it in `package` settings, or add your own
in your `~/.atom/keymap.cson` file.
